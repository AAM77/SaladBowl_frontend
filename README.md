## Plans

The application is a work in progress. I will return to it September 21, 2019 to finish working on it. I plan on refactoring the current code to make the application's code cleaner & more efficient. The first version will have another form that handles ingredient selection. The meal bowl cards will also display nutritional facts. I have other plans that I will not be making public at this time.

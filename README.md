# SaladBowl

## [ NOTE 1 ]: This is the front end of the application I created. Therefore, both have similar READMEs.
## [ NOTE 2 ]: I will return to this app to clean up the code and add more features as soon as I finish the Flatiron School curriculum.


## Background

One of my friends provided the inspiration for this application. In its current state, it returns randomly selected meals for a specific time of day.<br />
<br />
This application is split into two parts: <br />
(1) Back End: built using Ruby on Rails <br />
(2) Front End: built using JavaScript with React & Redux <br />


## Description

A limited list of features for the app include:

(1) Users can visit an 'About page'.<br />
(2) Users can visit a 'Log In' page to sign in using existing credentials.<br />
(3) Users can visit a 'Register' page to create a new account.<br />
(4) Users can visit a 'Breakfast Suggestions' page to get a list of four breakfast bowl suggestions.<br />
(5) Users can visit a 'Lunch Suggestions' page to get a list of four lunch bowl suggestions.<br />
(6) Users can visit a 'Dinner Suggestions' page to get a list of four dinner bowl suggestions.<br />
(7) Users can visit a 'Submit a Recipe' to visit a form they can fill out to suggest new salad bowl recipe.<br />
(8) Users can visit an 'Account' page to update their account information.<br />
(9) Users can click on the 'Log Out' option from the navigation bar to sign out.<br />
